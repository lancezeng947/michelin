But discerning locals know a great master when they see one, and Taketoshi Azumi is indeed the real deal. The chef has worked for two decades at top spots on both coasts and comes from a family of sushi connoisseurs. In fact, Shin is named for the Tokyo restaurant run by his late father, whose former sign now hangs behind the counter. Despite its pedigree, the vibe is affable and laid-back. Tables fill with as many diners ordering lunch combos as the omakase, and the friendly chef engages each customer as he slices their fish to order. His approach to shari is singular and highly personal, with a dense texture and mild flavor from sake lees vinegar. It makes a delicate base for some of the more unusual nigiri around, like a tiny bundle of Japanese chives tied with crispy nori and topped with bonito. Then look forward to the very rare and lightly torched snow trout, which is a marvel thanks to its smoky outer layer giving way to melting richness.

This is the kind of place where celebrants and gourmands come to enjoy a culinary show. Many courses begin with ingredients artfully arranged in the back kitchen and handed to the chef on trays, then finished before your eyes and presented with detailed explanations. The chef's nightly omakase presents an impressive parade of sashimi along with grilled, fried, steamed and simmered items. Seafood is sparkling beyond compare, especially the intense and focused presentation of a hollowed-out snow crab shell filled with seasoned rice, roe and tomalley.

Its pair of plush rooms feels like a hunter’s cabin gone Danish chic, complete with taxidermy galore and fiberglass fish commingling surprisingly well with sparkling stemware and modern, throw-draped furniture. But all eyes eventually drift to the gorgeous display kitchen, where cooks tend to a live fire that gently perfumes the room with wood smoke. The touch of those embers can be felt everywhere—from the infused cream in an elevated White Russian to an intensely concentrated and roasted tomato relish piled atop a fresh-peeled beefsteak tomato. Impeccable sourcing is another one of Chef Joshua Skenes' signatures: fluke crudo in a sour plum vinaigrette is likely to have been caught that morning and picked from the tank just moments before serving. Despite such meticulousness, Angler retains some humor by transforming rabbit into the world's most lavish riff on Nashville hot chicken, or slipping a bracing tot of beer into the creamy ganache of a chocolate mille-feuille.

Critically acclaimed Chef William Bradley spins out one long dinner every evening, which is brought to you at the hands of gracious, polished and effortless servers. His French-influenced compositions are downright gorgeous, brightened up with a touch of southern California sparkle—and every resulting morsel is nothing short of revelatory.

There is a happy sort of vibe here, ensuring that everyone is chatting by the end of their meal. Behind that ubiquitous bar, Chef Atsushi Yokoyama is a one-man show, lending artistry to the feast without getting caught up in the pomp or fuss. The superlative sashimi and nigiri stand tall and are never overwrought. The freshness of this seafood is center stage when the chef presents live Santa Barbara prawns—you may even find yourself reaching for the camera to capture the swift knife skills and morsels of that sweet and slightly quivering tail meat. Cooked dishes are just as interesting, such as a trio of small bites including deep-fried Japanese river crab arranged to look as though it is climbing onto a stack of baby corn and anago tempura.

The result is a unique experience, which commences on the open-air rooftop where guests are presented with a welcome cocktail and canapés, before being escorted downstairs to the somewhat severe dining room.

The chef has not forgotten his background at The French Laundry or Alinea, and uses it to build something wholly unexpected. Fans wait with bated breath for a highly conceptual meal that can last for hours and may not be for everyone.

The itamae will ask how much you’d like to eat, and so begins this memorable meal. After soups such as miso with special seaweed, the precise slicing and crafting of each morsel commences. This may include red snapper with salt and lemon or halibut with yuzu zest, tailed by live prawns where the tail becomes sushi dolloped with shrimp roe and the head disappears into the kitchen for frying. Then comes the parade of pieces brushed with nikiri, like lean tuna and bluefin toro. Finally, that shrimp head re-emerges to finish your meal with a beautiful bit of crunch.

Set in an attractive and neutral-toned dining room, the space holds a devoted, almost cult-like reverence. It makes sense: guests don’t want to miss a morsel of Chef Nakayama’s genius. Her clever creations are delightfully unbound by Japanese tradition; instead, she rather inventively works within the spirit of it. A nightly tasting menu might begin with a small glass of apple sake, followed by pristine scallop tartare coupled with sanbaizu gelée, carrot purée, toasted sunflower seeds and crispy carrot chips.

This ship is steady with Chef Masanori “Maru” Nagano at the helm, explaining the provenance of each bite of the nigiri and omakase. A majority of the selection is flown in directly from Japan—with a few worthy exceptions, including the luscious Santa Barbara uni.

When it comes to the nigiri, the chef also shares his alma mater’s attention to detail and insistence on consistency.

Each component of this sushi is prepared with paramount care, right down to the blend of vinegars that season the rice. The selection of fish may sound familiar—shrimp, cuts of tuna, uni—but demonstrates the careful craftsmanship of Chef Toshio Suzuki, who spent an age honing his skills at Sushi Zen. A trio of sashimi is served with three distinct sauces for dipping. This is followed by a simmered dish, like braised monkfish liver with sesame salt.

Culinary wunderkind Dan Barber has become a global icon for his zero-waste philosophy, which is expressed all the way down to the bone ash china gracing the tables and kitchen scraps transformed into charcoal. The capacious dining room, formerly a dairy barn, features dark wood beams and pale walls that take on a warm glow. Artful arrangements of flowers and vegetables create a near-theatrical rendering of the land's power and presence. Meals begin with an onslaught of clever bites, mostly vegetables plucked from the property's greenhouses and working farm.

These slabs of finely marbled Porterhouse are dry-aged in-house for around 28 days, which means there’s tenderloin on one side of the bone and strip steak on the other. They are then broiled to perfection, sliced before being brought to the table, and served with their own sauce as well as a host of sides, which range from their version of German fried potatoes to creamed spinach.

Danish chef Ronny Emborg and his team serve up a nightly menu of around 20 courses, progressing from the light and subtle to the rich and robust. There may be plenty of tweezer action from the chefs as they plate up their beguiling creations, but they know that there’s nowhere to hide when food is this precise and delicate.

The Ash Room seats seven at the counter and offers a pure expression of seasonal nigiri, while the 200-year-old Hinoki Counter is where Chef Nozomu Abe presides and prepares a tasting menu of small plates in addition to the seasonal omakase.

Eating here may be a serious business, but happily the place isn’t blighted by a monastic atmosphere—a contented buzz fills the room, helped along by the chefs who deliver the dishes themselves and describe them with contagious enthusiasm. Expect around 19 courses—that may seem daunting but each one, whether a squid tart or meltingly soft dry-aged ribeye, is small and exquisitely formed. Swedish chef Fredrik Berselius and his team use a myriad of techniques from fermenting and pickling to curing, smoking and preserving.
