Its pair of plush rooms feels like a hunter’s cabin gone Danish chic, complete with taxidermy galore and fiberglass fish commingling surprisingly well with sparkling stemware and modern, throw-draped furniture. But all eyes eventually drift to the gorgeous display kitchen, where cooks tend to a live fire that gently perfumes the room with wood smoke. The touch of those embers can be felt everywhere—from the infused cream in an elevated White Russian to an intensely concentrated and roasted tomato relish piled atop a fresh-peeled beefsteak tomato. Impeccable sourcing is another one of Chef Joshua Skenes' signatures: fluke crudo in a sour plum vinaigrette is likely to have been caught that morning and picked from the tank just moments before serving. Despite such meticulousness, Angler retains some humor by transforming rabbit into the world's most lavish riff on Nashville hot chicken, or slipping a bracing tot of beer into the creamy ganache of a chocolate mille-feuille.

Fine silver, crystal, champagne and caviar complete the decadence. The wine list is presented as a gold-embossed book of wooden pages. The classic French cooking strives to recreate many of the century's great dishes through recipes on loan from culinary masters, such as Alain Ducasse and Paul Bocuse. The concise menu evolves with the seasons as it offers traditional cooking alongside some of Bar Crenn's own creations. Start with the rendition of Chef Guy Savoy's huîtres en nage glacée, with two Washington State oysters on the half shell topped with oyster cream and a gelée made from its liquor.

The funky 80s rock music in the background certainly helps preserve a laid-back vibe. His tasting menu underlines the cuisine of the Pacific Northwest, with a deeper emphasis on the intense flavors of wood fire. Perfectly grilled lamb-stuffed mushrooms are standouts, accompanied by the likes of custardy blue-corn bread matched with charcoal butter. The chef also flaunts immense skill with dehydrated and cured ingredients, transforming humble carrots into a tender, “meaty” marvel, or wrapping a cylinder of crisp pork belly around luscious caviar and chives for an enticing blast of flavor.

The menu is full of these clever touches, from the tomalley that adds depth to a rich Dungeness crab egg custard to the “tentacles” of fried fennel that echo the texture of salt-and-pepper squid.

Nevertheless, a seat at the ubiquitous counter is likely to deliver a happier outcome. From the non-sushi items, diners may be presented with poached monkfish liver, a creamy potato croquette dolloped with salmon roe or a salad of shaved apple and mizuna. The real knockouts though arrive on rice: squid with a touch of shiso and Meyer lemon zest; silky salmon with house-made yuzu kosho; custardy uni imported from Japan, wrapped in roasted seaweed; and to finish, a melt-in-your-mouth slice of gently seared A5 Wagyu beef.",1.0,1.0,0.0,"['Wheelchair accessible', 'Establishment totally or partly reserved for non-smokers']",+1 415-682-4875,www.sushiwakosf.com,Dinner Tue - Sat,37.783035,-122.461525,https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/san-francisco/restaurant/wako,United States,US,,75.0,150.0,JAPANESE,0,NC

But when it comes to delivering authentically layered, fiery Thai flavor with a produce-driven northern California flair, it has no equal. Kin Khao's menu conjures up dishes from across Thailand and is a virtual homage to local purveyors. Imagine a meaty and rich five-spice noodle soup infused with duck bones and stocked with bok choy as well as delightfully tender duck leg confit; or a deliciously fresh take on som tum, with julienned green papaya tossed with golden tomatoes, long beans, dried shrimp and crushed red chili. More traditional options may include classic pad kee mao showcasing wide, flat noodles stir-fried with a potent mixture of ground pork bits, bell pepper, onion and holy basil. Needless to say, those avoiding spicy food or craving plain old pad Thai should look elsewhere. But, if you're in the mood for a vibrant and zesty meal, then strap in for a wild and enticing ride.

Because Chefs/owners Evan and Sarah Rich execute casual Californian fare with fine-dining precision, interweaving a bevy of global influences along the way. The seared pierogies, stuffed with ricotta, morels and peas, are pristine enough to win a Polish grandmother’s approval, and a char siu-style pork chop is beautifully smoky and charred.

It is always best to be prompt: the formal service team is gracious but handles each night’s single seating with precision, serving all guests at once. Such punctuality is crucial as this kitchen takes its work and its mission rather earnestly. Chef Keiko Takahashi's nightly tasting menu is a progression of French culinary technique with subtle hints of Japanese flavors. Her success is undeniable from the first taste of spiny lobster presented in a martini glass with lobster-tomato water foam and a chilled layer of fruity bell pepper mousse.

These delicacies alone rival some of the country's most ambitious tasting menus, but wait, there's more.

Original is the name of this culinary game—one that is as thoughtful in serving brioche with cultured butter as it is with caviar crowned by turbot gelée and gold leaf. Poached sea bass with black truffles then happily wins over the most discerning of palates. It is indeed possible to dine here and not see any meat, but it’s also never missed, thanks to the team's masterful hand with seafood.

The kitchen's approach showcases Middle Eastern flavors and incorporates classic ingredients, like labneh, which appears in both sweet and savory dishes. Wild king salmon is accompanied by a coriander-green tomato sauce; the dry-aged strip loin with matbucha sauce is a prime example of the kitchen's novel direction. While you won't find the famed trios on this carte any longer, you'll relish the signature tuna tartare, mixed with quail egg, diced pear and ancho chili powder. A multi-course tasting allows you to select your own options, including the hand-cut tajarin and a properly rendered dark chocolate crémeux with fresh strawberries.

Then, translucent, moist and bite-sized king salmon matched with smooth celeriac purée will leave you yearning for more—quite like the enticingly sauced filet of meltingly tender venison, and in true California style, charred avocado.
