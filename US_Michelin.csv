But discerning locals know a great master when they see one, and Taketoshi Azumi is indeed the real deal. The chef has worked for two decades at top spots on both coasts and comes from a family of sushi connoisseurs. In fact, Shin is named for the Tokyo restaurant run by his late father, whose former sign now hangs behind the counter. Despite its pedigree, the vibe is affable and laid-back. Tables fill with as many diners ordering lunch combos as the omakase, and the friendly chef engages each customer as he slices their fish to order. His approach to shari is singular and highly personal, with a dense texture and mild flavor from sake lees vinegar. It makes a delicate base for some of the more unusual nigiri around, like a tiny bundle of Japanese chives tied with crispy nori and topped with bonito. Then look forward to the very rare and lightly torched snow trout, which is a marvel thanks to its smoky outer layer giving way to melting richness.

This is the kind of place where celebrants and gourmands come to enjoy a culinary show. Many courses begin with ingredients artfully arranged in the back kitchen and handed to the chef on trays, then finished before your eyes and presented with detailed explanations. The chef's nightly omakase presents an impressive parade of sashimi along with grilled, fried, steamed and simmered items. Seafood is sparkling beyond compare, especially the intense and focused presentation of a hollowed-out snow crab shell filled with seasoned rice, roe and tomalley.

Its pair of plush rooms feels like a hunter’s cabin gone Danish chic, complete with taxidermy galore and fiberglass fish commingling surprisingly well with sparkling stemware and modern, throw-draped furniture. But all eyes eventually drift to the gorgeous display kitchen, where cooks tend to a live fire that gently perfumes the room with wood smoke. The touch of those embers can be felt everywhere—from the infused cream in an elevated White Russian to an intensely concentrated and roasted tomato relish piled atop a fresh-peeled beefsteak tomato. Impeccable sourcing is another one of Chef Joshua Skenes' signatures: fluke crudo in a sour plum vinaigrette is likely to have been caught that morning and picked from the tank just moments before serving. Despite such meticulousness, Angler retains some humor by transforming rabbit into the world's most lavish riff on Nashville hot chicken, or slipping a bracing tot of beer into the creamy ganache of a chocolate mille-feuille.

Glossy windows overlook the golf course greens, and guests settle in for one of San Diego's most coveted meals. Critically acclaimed Chef William Bradley spins out one long dinner every evening, which is brought to you at the hands of gracious, polished and effortless servers. His French-influenced compositions are downright gorgeous, brightened up with a touch of southern California sparkle—and every resulting morsel is nothing short of revelatory.

Following suit, the clued-up staff excels in every way. Centered around a sleek open kitchen and counter, a petite patio as well as a few tables offer supplemental seating in the dining room. Here, diners may look forward to such deeply intricate dishes as a carrot and masa tamal drizzled with mole Amarillo; or sea scallops gratinados with Chihuahua cheese and squid ink breadcrumbs.

There is a happy sort of vibe here, ensuring that everyone is chatting by the end of their meal. Behind that ubiquitous bar, Chef Atsushi Yokoyama is a one-man show, lending artistry to the feast without getting caught up in the pomp or fuss. The superlative sashimi and nigiri stand tall and are never overwrought. The freshness of this seafood is center stage when the chef presents live Santa Barbara prawns—you may even find yourself reaching for the camera to capture the swift knife skills and morsels of that sweet and slightly quivering tail meat. Cooked dishes are just as interesting, such as a trio of small bites including deep-fried Japanese river crab arranged to look as though it is climbing onto a stack of baby corn and anago tempura.

The result is a unique experience, which commences on the open-air rooftop where guests are presented with a welcome cocktail and canapés, before being escorted downstairs to the somewhat severe dining room. Following suit, highly professional servers deliver this specific narrative. The chef has not forgotten his background at The French Laundry or Alinea, and uses it to build something wholly unexpected. Fans wait with bated breath for a highly conceptual meal that can last for hours and may not be for everyone.

The itamae will ask how much you’d like to eat, and so begins this memorable meal. After soups such as miso with special seaweed, the precise slicing and crafting of each morsel commences. This may include red snapper with salt and lemon or halibut with yuzu zest, tailed by live prawns where the tail becomes sushi dolloped with shrimp roe and the head disappears into the kitchen for frying. Then comes the parade of pieces brushed with nikiri, like lean tuna and bluefin toro. Finally, that shrimp head re-emerges to finish your meal with a beautiful bit of crunch.

Set in an attractive and neutral-toned dining room, the space holds a devoted, almost cult-like reverence. It makes sense: guests don’t want to miss a morsel of Chef Nakayama’s genius. Her clever creations are delightfully unbound by Japanese tradition; instead, she rather inventively works within the spirit of it. A nightly tasting menu might begin with a small glass of apple sake, followed by pristine scallop tartare coupled with sanbaizu gelée, carrot purée, toasted sunflower seeds and crispy carrot chips.

Even the wine and sake list is restrained, with each varietal specifically chosen to complement the fish. Despite such delicacy, Mori is far from stuffy. This ship is steady with Chef Masanori “Maru” Nagano at the helm, explaining the provenance of each bite of the nigiri and omakase. A majority of the selection is flown in directly from Japan—with a few worthy exceptions, including the luscious Santa Barbara uni.

Fresh flowers add a bit of flourish and fun. It’s the kind of pristine culinary experience that connoisseurs and foodies crave. And since this kitchen boasts some of the best sushi in town, be sure to make reservations.

Kin Khao's menu conjures up dishes from across Thailand and is a virtual homage to local purveyors. Imagine a meaty and rich five-spice noodle soup infused with duck bones and stocked with bok choy as well as delightfully tender duck leg confit; or a deliciously fresh take on som tum, with julienned green papaya tossed with golden tomatoes, long beans, dried shrimp and crushed red chili. More traditional options may include classic pad kee mao showcasing wide, flat noodles stir-fried with a potent mixture of ground pork bits, bell pepper, onion and holy basil.

The good news is that, thanks to the great Dane Claus Meyer, you don’t need to fly there to find out more.

Maybe that’s because the talented chef behind this operation, Ignacio Mattos, is unfaltering and impressively consistent in his creative renditions of such bold and iconic dishes as ricotta dumplings with mushrooms and Pecorino Sardo. The menu goes on to offer an array of shareable plates that changes regularly, but if you spot that delightful risotto special, jump on it and worry about the calories later. Dinner might kick off with perfect, sashimi-grade tuna accompanied by woodsy black trumpet mushrooms and elevated by a smooth and tart mirin-soy sauce.

At lunch there are even “modestly alcoholic” choices like the very perky plum with Lillet Blanc. At this point you should be nibbling on something from their “first order” part of the menu, such as polenta fries or tandoor bread.

He looks young because he is young, but then again he started early and garnered over eight years’ experience at the highly garlanded Sushi Saito in Tokyo before setting sail for NYC. His experience is evident in the number of dishes served before the nigiri, which may include creamy uni from different regions of Japan; delicious hairy crab served in its shell; steamed scallop wrapped in nori; and tender abalone. When it comes to the nigiri, the chef also shares his alma mater’s attention to detail and insistence on consistency. Each piece is given just a light brush of nikiri so that the focus remains on its natural flavor, whether that’s the silvery kohada, luminous white squid or the golden anago.

Some of the chefs are more enthusiastic than others when it comes to engaging with the diners seated opposite them, but all work with the same practiced, fluid movements. At dinner, the omakase is a more significant affair—reflected in the prices—where the chefs demonstrate their mastery over a number of different seasonal fish.

Danzer and Redding’s offerings are certainly rooted in this nation’s cuisine, but they give each dish a unique spin thereby infusing vibrant flavor into small plates, large plates, “charcoal-grilled goodies,” desserts and drinking snacks.

Well-priced, product-driven tasting menus make this dining experience utterly enjoyable.

The room is lively and packed but always conducive to conversations. Tacos may be the main draw, especially when their delightful tortillas are piled with superb lamb barbacoa or soft-shell crab. However, this kitchen doesn’t stick to one dish or even area of Mexico. Instead, it reaches widely across myriad regions, always balancing abundance with fresh and vibrant flavors.

Despite ample competition in this section of town, Chef/owner Polo Dobkin and wife, Stephanie Lempert, manage to elevate the kitchen’s dishes into next-level territory, and they do so in a lovely, urbane setting with loads of charm and friendly service. The inventive American menu gets a lift from Mediterranean accents: fried artichokes served with a tangle of bitter-spicy arugula in a creamy vinaigrette are positively addictive.

Nothing commences a meal here like the crudo (and this kitchen offers around 12 to choose from), but other generously sized antipasti, like grilled octopus with smoked potatoes or Nova Scotia lobster paired with burrata offer comfort and flavor. House-made pastas remain a highlight, as seen in the gnocchetti tossed with tomatoes, shrimp, chilies, and rosemary oil. But if you're craving something different, get the spigola striata—or striped sea bass—served with smoky grilled leeks and tender butter beans.

This sleek and sultry space dons an ultra-modern design that features the signature red-and-black color scheme, as well as a pristine open kitchen. Centered around a glossy cherry wood counter, the dining room draws inspiration from those convivial sushi and tapas bars; it also offers an up close and personal view of the cooks in action. As expected, the iconic cuisine is every bit as luxurious as one might imagine. Lavish ingredients like foie gras, truffle and caviar aren't just accents here, but stellar components of many plates.

Donning just the right amount of glamour to add to any sense of occasion, this warmly lit space is helmed by a personable team who makes every diner feel like they’re in safe hands. This is also the type of establishment that exudes old-school New York from its every pore—and is ideal for those for whom eating out is a visceral pleasure, rather than something to be photographed, posted, and blogged. The cooking walks a pleasing line between comforting and creative and never feels faddish or contrived. In a refreshing break from current mores, dishes are more about flavor than presentation—and their size bears witness to the largesse of the kitchen. Though far from avant-garde, the likes of a well-prepared tuna tartare or roasted rack of lamb with wilted spinach and potato purée will never go out of style.

But really, everyone is here for the food—and that food is very good indeed. Chef Markus Glocker’s cooking is precise and his dishes look quite delicate on the plate. But like a good featherweight they pack more of a punch than you’re expecting. An umami-rich broth may arrive with beautifully shaped caramelle stuffed with shallots, herbs and morels; but, also consider the Arctic char, gently laid over a pool of caramelized onion soubise and accompanied by deep-fried asparagus.

Cleary chef driven, dishes here flaunt focus and style while utilizing a host of global ingredients.

While the menu format may be fixed, dishes change frequently to reflect the young chefs’ wide-ranging talents and contemporary flair. This kitchen really plays it up, presenting textures and ingredients in unusual, but appealing ways. Case in point? The skate, perfectly creamy and set over a surprisingly savory and tart sauce of pickled blueberries, green olives and parsley. The heartbreakingly tender Wagyu topped with chamomile-flavored butter alongside porcini-stuffed cabbage is another winner.

198,Mako,"731 W. Lake St., Chicago, 60661, United States",200.0,200.0,USD,JAPANESE,"After making a name for his tasting menus at Lincoln Park's Juno, veteran sushi chef B. K. Park has spun out this inspiring shrine to omakase. With nothing but a single plaque marking its entrance, this Japanese gem can be tough to spot. But once inside its tranquil dining room, the surrounding din of roaring traffic fades into the background and you’ll be entirely transfixed by the chef's dedication to the sushi craft. Mako is a hot ticket, with just 22 seats in which to savor the smartly considered omakase, featuring black sea bream wrapped around ankimo; pickled chayote crowned with a micro fava leaf; Osetra caviar; as well as king crab with uni miso, A5 Wagyu butter, and a potato chip. Equally enticing are its seasonal sushi and cooked dishes, like poached abalone braised with soy sauce and finished with just the right brush of XO sauce; as well as sea bass with charred frisée and seaweed. Not to be outdone, artistically presented chutoro and smoked salmon sashimi flaunt ace flavor and flawless texture. Chawanmushi stocked with mushroom and crab is the very essence of classic refinement.

The best seats in the house are those with views of the open kitchen, where Chef Mari Katsumura and her team can be seen preparing and delivering thoughtfully composed meals. Begin with such crowning canapes as king crab with Japanese hollandaise or a texturally exquisite duo of both raw and fried seaweed coupled with creamed celery root. This may be tailed by luscious yellowtail sashimi; still warm Norwegian fjord trout; fluffly crab rice studded with confit egg yolk; or even okara agnolotti with wild huckleberries. Seal the regal meal with a plate of ""Milk & Cookies"" unveiling hōjicha ice cream that's covered in buttermilk foam and then topped with thin shards of crisp meringue as well as a thick swipe of caramelized milk. But wait, there's more. The wine list offers sake by the glass, including a trio of namazake (unpasteurized selections) to celebrate the arrival of spring.

200,Band of Bohemia,"4710 N. Ravenswood Ave., Chicago, 60640, United States",50.0,75.0,USD,GASTROPUB,"So much more than a working brewery with a talented kitchen, Band of Bohemia is in fact a truly inspired gastropub that produces its own utterly unique creations both in the glass and on the plate. Located in a repurposed brick building across from the Metra tracks, the look is unapologetically industrial with an expansive layout that unwinds into a series of seating options, inviting bar, and an open kitchen with another small bar set against pretty blue tiles. Curved, high-backed booths lend intimacy to counter the room’s sheer size. Stainless steel tanks displayed in the back hold the culinary-minded handiwork of their head brewer. On tap, expect a handful of rotating beers. The kitchen’s boundless small and large plates defy expectations with delicious success. Scallop ceviche straddles the line between sweet and sour courtesy of chartreuse, candied ginger, and roast shishito peppers. Who knew a single carrot could have such power? Salt-cured, roasted, and glazed in miso caramel, then set upon beluga lentils and creamy coconut milk—it's a revelation.

Muted tones in the exposed brick walls and custom tile floors complement newer elements like floor-to-ceiling wine storage and dramatic smoke-shaded chandeliers that drip with crystals. Though the décor may tip its hat to yesteryear, the ambience is decidedly inviting and Chef Andrew Zimmerman’s cuisine is firmly grounded in the present. Settle into one of their spacious tables and look forward to a meal that reflects the delicious amalgam of American cuisine, with hints of Southeast Asian, Korean and Mediterranean tastes. But, it is at dinner when this kitchen truly shines. Gnocchi for instance may seem commonplace, but this version is memorable thanks to the flawless components and rich flavors of lamb sugo and ciabatta breadcrumbs. Chicken is downright exciting, served crisp-skinned with a buttery Albufera sauce, crumbly chestnuts, caramelized fennel and sausage. Simple-sounding desserts keep the bar high until the very end of the feast, and may include a toffee-coconut cake with chocolate ganache and burnt caramel.",1.0,2.0,1.0,"['Notable cocktail list', 'Wheelchair accessible', 'Notable wine list', 'Establishment totally or partly reserved for non-smokers', 'Private dining rooms', 'Valet parking']",+1 312-441-1920,www.sepiachicago.com,Closed: Saturday-Sunday lunch,41.88394,-87.64246999999997,https://guide.michelin.com/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/sepia,United States,US,,50.0,75.0,AMERICAN,1,CHI

There is one seating, everyone is served at the same time and meals are prepaid so guests can linger or leave at their leisure. The fact that the restaurant resembles a test kitchen is heightened when guests are told to manage their BYO beverages themselves and cooks deliver dishes to your table. Don’t worry—they turn the music down so you can hear each description. Yet this is all part of the show; it’s a fun, friendly, totally unique experience. The cuisine follows suit and works wonders by pushing—if not completely disregarding—the traditional boundaries of cooking. Breaking barriers is par for the course: a croquette filled with Caesar dressing set on strips of romaine is to be eaten by licking the plate. Other outlandish surprises include hibiscus-cured salmon with aquachile sorbet, avocado crema and hibiscus gel with a dense chip. Then there is the brilliantly fun French fries and ice cream course, which is designed to look like a milkshake and made in part with a hot potato-leek soup.

203,Schwa,"1466 N. Ashland Ave., Chicago, 60662, United States",80.0,150.0,USD,CONTEMPORARY,"There comes a point when pared-down style jumps from being easy-to-miss and becomes hard-to-forget. When a utilitarian and self-consciously bare-bones interior becomes attractively modern and industrial. When a lack of any FOH staff makes the service seem playfully all-hands-on-deck. The explicit rap music in the background reflects the deeply talented chefs’ ethos, going well beyond laissez-faire to reach the point of “we don’t give a damn. ” You probably won’t either once you taste the food—not every dish works, but when it does, the result is sublime. Chef de Cuisine Norman Fenton makes his mark on this menu by way of the inventive ""Welcome to Schwa"" dish, unveiling a spicy Bloody Mary-inspired drink and crisp, savory waffle. The latter is intended to accompany the highlight of the course, namely: two rows of vibrant purées that spell out the greeting in Morse code. Such technical trickery continues into a plate of homemade pappardelle, laced with beurre monté and paired with peas and uni bubbles; or poached foie gras, delicately laid over trumpet mushrooms and mango gel.

Exposed brick, that roaring fireplace and large windows overlooking the park and namesake pond make the rooms feel warm and pleasant. A commitment to agriculture is clear in everything: seed packets arrive with the check and each bottle of wine has a one-dollar surcharge that is donated to charities like the Lincoln Park Conservancy or Chicago Rarities Orchard Project. Chef Bruce Sherman's particular style seems to fly in the face of those minimalist competitors who use menus to list single ingredients. Here, dishes are described comprehensively as a flurry of components that may not always seem to fit together with great success. Try neatly trimmed Arctic char that is slow-roasted for silken texture, then served with embellishments like house-made sauerkraut, mustard seeds, candied walnuts and dauphine potatoes.
